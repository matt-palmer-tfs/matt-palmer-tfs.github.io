[Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Git is an exceptional tool when it comes to source code management, but it still requires a level of knowledge to use properly. No one would let an untrained person use heavy machinery, and git is no different. While a mistake may not cost you thousands of dollars in physical damage in using git, it may result in millions in damages if sensitive information is leaked online.
Countless users incorrectly use git and this causes news headlines throughout the world. Proper training seems to be scarce in this space, and I felt a brief overview on my experiences in git may prove useful to some.

## Proper tool use

While git, like every tool, has a very loose user guide, there are still many best practices that should be followed to prevent harm. This includes understanding the quick way is not always the correct way. While not every best practice under the sun must be followed, it is a great Idea to read up on all the ways people are streamlining security into their use of git.

### Not-Good Practice

It may be alluring to run a quick command to add your files and commit them all at once, but what if this adds files you **don't** want public?

<details>
  <summary> Code gore warning</summary>
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
git add *
git commit -m '<USER NAME> Auto push change'
git push -f origin master
```
</details>

The above is an actual code example that a fellow developer had aliased out to his local shell and used to streamline his coding commits. There are many things wrong with this specific approach above. Before I dive into what could go wrong, I must say that I am not against setting up user aliases that can streamline process. For example, typing in `git commit -m` every time gets tiresome, and I have this aliased myself. However, putting an alias that makes drastic assumptions on the intended flow is neither safe nor appropriate; especially with git.

Diving back into the example, the first thing wrong it assuming we are adding EVERY file into source. `git add *` essentially takes the current working directory, and adds all files that are not included in a [.gitignore](#specifics-every-repo-should-have) to the commit. Now let's say you have a test configuration file with sensitive information for a development database stored locally in the working directory. While this is still a bad practice, it typically will not cause any issues, as it will be short lived, and probably removed soon after testing. However, running the above alias would add this config file into the commit and push it right up to source. Now this "short lived" file is available in the commit history of the repository until the end of time (or until the repo is deleted). By having this shortcut alias, you have inadvertently added sensitive information to your commit, and potentially exposed your database to harm. And the worst part about this situation is that it may be hours or even days until it is discovered by you or another member of your team/community, and that is the best case scenario. The more likely outcome is a black hat is now in possession of the details to the development system through automated crawling of repositories.

Lets break down what not to do in this scenario.

#### git add

##### Bad approach

```bash
git add *
```

This is a clear no-go approach. You should never openly add everything in the working directory to git. As many precious seconds as it takes, the better approach would be to selectively add the files that have been changed.

##### Good approach

```bash
git add README.md src/files/i/changed.conf
```

This will only add to the commit the files explicitly stated in the add command. Now you don't need to rely on a complete .gitignore to protect you.

#### git commit

```bash
git commit -m '<USER NAME> Auto push change'
```

This is a bad thing to do because a commit message should have details on what was changed and how it impacts the code. Meaningful commit messages are how useful change-logs and release notes are generated, so for the longevity of the repository, it is worth it to take a few extra seconds and write out a proper message.

#### git push

```bash
git push -f origin master
```

There are a few things wrong here. First and foremost, using the `-f` flag, or `--force` should only be done in the most extreme of situations. Arbitrary use of the force flag should not be done as a regular occurrence.
![git-push-force](../../assets/gitpush-force.jpg)

Any reason a commit would be rejected from the remote is usually the appropriate behavior. It means the commit history on your local branch is either behind or inconsistent with the history on the remote. By forcing the commit, you essentially rewrite what is the "source of truth" to the commit chain you have local, potentially overwriting changes that have been committed by other developers. If you know for a fact that you were the last developer to commit and you are trying to fix an issue you caused in a critical branch, forcing may be appropriate, but usually is not.

A better approach would be to simply remove the `-f` flag to allow git to manage its history, and reject commits when they should be.

##### Why use force

The few reasons that force **should** be used must also be documented. In general, if your team is using a branching strategy that wants to maintain a commit in a different branch, this could be a reason to force. By using `git push --force` on a branch commit, it maintains the sha of the commit, and avoids creating a new commit.

Another reason force could be used is if there is an emergency situation where code that was broken was pushed to a release stage. This can only be done safely if you are the last one to commit to this release branch, and you can verify no other users will commit/pull during this time. If these both are true, a forced commit to fix a breaking change could be done. Even if a small commit gets through in this time, it is best to **NOT** force push, and instead consider it a hot-fix that follows the standard merge procedures.

In general this entire alias should be avoided. Every logical step in the git process should be critiqued to avoid sensitive leaks and clean git histories.

## Branches Strategy

Another topic most people struggle with is the concept of branches. A Branch is a glorified concept of a internal repo fork. It is a snapshot of the code at the specific time the branch is created, and until it is merged back, it is its own code fork.

Using git, I consider there to be three different approaches to branching.

* gitflow
* trunking
* three-flow

All strategies work, it is just up to the team to implement it properly. By themselves, the branching strategy does not solve any underlying issue teams may have, so don't arbitrarily enforce any one of these as a solution.

### Gitflow

![gitflow](../../assets/gitflow.png)

Without the semantics of what gitflow is, this is the most common approach teams take when starting to use git.
There are many different branches that are in flight at any time, but the main concept is that `master` is the defacto release branch. The issue we can get into very quickly is when branches become long lived, and end up with many conflicting commits, or when hotfixes are not applied appropriately to `master`.
To this end, the `master` branch then becomes the parking lot for all code, but not necessarily the release.

### Trunking

~[trunking](../../assets/trunking.png)

This approach was popularized by Google, and for good reason. It takes the concept of `master` as the source of truth, and the assumed "trunk" of the git tree. All commits are made directly to the trunk branch, and releases are "cut" from the trunk. Once these releases are cut, they are never committed to directly. This way, code is always releasable from master, and feature branches are very short lived. It does require a high level of discipline to avoid issues when committing directly to master, and usually has large scale CI/CD tooling for automated reviews and testing for any changes that may be introduced.

### Three-Flow

![three-flow](../../assets/three-flow.png)

A newer concept in the same chain as git flow is the three-flow concept. This takes the git flow concept and moves it into only using 3 branches, all of which are long long lived. `master` is still the primary focus for all work, but there are two additional branches; `candidate` and `release`. These two branches are essentially the RC and Release itself, and it works through a tagging cut process similar to trunking. This means master is always the most up to date branch, but releases are not cut directly from it. Instead the release is tested in the `candidate` branch (merged from master) and then the intended release is cut to the release branch as a single commit.

## Other Good Practices

There are many other things a user should be aware of when using git. So far, I have only scratched the surface of git and how most developers use it.

* Merge Strategies
  * Rebase, fast forwards and squashes are all terms I hear thrown around and people always seem to have an opinion on one of them, but very few understand the full implications of each.
  * Atlassian has a great write-up on [how each merge strategies work](https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/pull-request-merge-strategies-the-great-debate/), and is definitely worth a read.
* Signing commits
  * Most source control systems allow the users to add GPG keys to *verify* a commit. This adds a flag signalling a commit made by the user is verified by the GPG key that was signed to it, proving it was the correct person. I won't go into the details on what GPG keys are or how to use them, but [github has a great article](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits) on how to use them. In practice, you can even prevent commits from being merged in if they were not signed, which could be a boon to security if executed properly.
* Tagging
  * You should follow the standard [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for any release you make via MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. It is also best practice to append a `v` to the beginning of every version (at least from github's standard) but it is not required. In the 2.0.0 semver standard, it is considered optional.

## Specifics every Repo Should Have

This is a list of the things [I feel] every repository should have. There are a few that are specific to the platform they are located on, but nearly all should be included in every repository created.

### Base

These files should ALWAYS exist in your repo unless a reason indicated is not applicable.

* **`.gitignore`**
  * This file should always be included no matter what. This is the final line of defense between a file and it being added to git. These files are also extremely important in removing any files that have no place in git. These could include build directories from local testing as well as any cache or hidden files that could be added in error. The most common use is to avoid adding the .git folder as well as language specific patterns.
  * A great resource straight from github: [Gitignore Examples](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
* **`.editorconfig`**
  * This file is not always needed, but is extremely valuable when working with multiple developers around the world. Everyone has their own style syntax, and keeping them in line is a challenge. Committing an .editorconfig file will keep this synchronized.
  * See the main page for info: [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
* **`README.md`**
  * The 'What is this thing' signpost of your repository. This file serves as a an explanation on what your repository is for, and a general guide on how to use it. This also should never have an exception unless the goal is to make difficult to use and understand code.
  * `*/**/README.md` (wherever most applicable to describe use)
    * Including more than one README may also be appropriate if there are many directories that house very specific code that may not be appropriate to separate into a different repository.
* **`LICENSE.txt`**
  * An included License file is also a huge requirement to prevent legal troubles in the future. If you want your code to be truly free and open source, you must License your code to be so.
  * LINK: [Licensing a Repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#disclaimer)
* **`CHANGELOG.md`**
  * While not always required, it is a great tool to track major changes to a project that directly affect end users. This could be a combination of multiple fixes or version changes from related issues all packed into one. Proper linking to issues is very helpful for tracing back older changes, rather than forcing users to spelunk down the commit chain.
* **`CODEOWNERS` (github)**
  * A relative new file that is invaluable when using github. This file can be used to enforce reviews required for specific users during pull request. This is especially useful for teams that have many different locations for code within the same repo, and each could require specific SMEs to review. Rather than loosely requiring the review, this file strictly enforces the users that must give their blessing.
* **`CI/Build File`**
  * `Jenkinsfile`/`.travis.yml`/`.circleci/*`/`.gitlab-ci.yml` etc.
  * These files are the main "Continuous Integration" components when dealing with any repository. It provides the distributed ability for any maintainer to receive feedback in a near instant manner for any commit they make. These files are specific for the build and project you are working on, but in most organizations there will be a requirement of one of these.

## Docker specific

While not directly requirements for git, these files are invaluable in a Container focused world.

[Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)

* **`.dockerignore`**
  * A usually overlooked file when dealing with Docker, this can drastically reduce your container size when doing general `ADD` or `COPY` commands in your Dockerfile. This could also save you some headache when omitting certain directories from the container that have no right being included (such as .git/). While it could be argued that an explicit Dockerfile could have no need for .dockerignore, it is a great tool to preventing the occasional "oops" moments.
* **`Dockerfile`**
  * A docker project is never complete without a Dockerfile. This is the proverbial "meat and potatoes" delivery system for any Containerized project. There is almost never a reason to not include a raw Dockerfile in your code if the end product is a Containerized output. In a similar way to how pip is used for python packages, you should use the tool that was designed for this approach.
* **`docker-compose.yml` - if needed**
  * A lesser used file, but a great tool for multi-container orchestration, docker-compose provides a way to deploy a multi container "app" with a single configuration file. This could prove useful for a build test or even a production end-state. Docker compose can provide the end users a very easy quick-start to your container application.
